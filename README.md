# Evolutionary Simular
## An implement of the NEAT (Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm 

This project implements the NEAT algorithm, which as an evolutionary approeach to training neural networks, and provides a GUI that allows.
Written in pure C++, with no external dependencies relating to the neural networks / evolution.
GUI made using ImGUI/OpenGL/WebGL, can run both in the browser using web assembly, and locally.
